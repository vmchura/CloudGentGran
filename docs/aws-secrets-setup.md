## Step 1: Create IAM Roles

The roles were created automatically when you run the setup script:

```bash
# Run the role creation script
chmod +x scripts/setup/create-iam-roles.sh
./scripts/setup/create-iam-roles.sh
```


### Step 2: Configure GitHub Secret

```bash
# Set the AWS Account ID
gh secret set AWS_ACCOUNT_ID --body "123456789012"
```
